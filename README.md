# Yelp-Dataset-Challenge---Changepoints-and-Events

Can you detect when things change suddenly (i.e. a business coming under new management)? Can you see when a city starts going nuts over cronuts?

What I did?

1. Filtered and parsed the Yelp.com datasets using Python.
2. Created buckets from the datasets and performed T-Test and Fisher Test to detect the changepoints in restaurantâ€™s rating and reviews.

Keep all the downloaded json files and python file in one folder before running the project.
